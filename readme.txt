== Description ==

Easily add custom order status for each product into the default WooCommerce. you can create unlimited custom statuses as per your business needs.

= WHY WE BUILT THIS PLUGIN? =

Default WooCommerce provided each order have a single " order status" (Completed / Cancelled /Refunded / Failed). we can not apply for individual order product status

If a customer bought multiple products and store owner wants to update one product status = " dispatched " and another product status = " Processing". This is not possible in default WooCommerce. We have overcome this limitation in our plugin.
